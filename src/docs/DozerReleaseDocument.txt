Labeling and Merging:

- The first thing we do is version the branch. Select the branch then right-click Team ( Tag as Version…


Name the version as below and click ‘Ok’.


- Right click --> Team --> Merge on your project in Eclipse. Make sure it is the HEAD branch.
- End tag should be latest version tag.
- Start tag should be the latest Root branch.
- On the synchronize view there is a button called ‘Merge All Non-conflicting changes’.
This obviously needs some work…
