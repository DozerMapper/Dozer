        Dozer is a Java Bean to Java Bean mapper that recursively copies data from one object to another.
        Typically, these Java Beans will be of different complex types.
      </p>
      <p>
        Dozer supports simple property mapping, complex type mapping, bi-directional mapping, implicit-explicit
        mapping, as well as recursive mapping. This includes mapping collection attributes that also need mapping
        at the element level.
      </p>
      <p>
        Dozer not only supports mapping between attribute names, but also automatically converting between types.
        Most conversion scenarios are supported out of the box, but Dozer also allows you to specify custom
        conversions via XML.
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        The mapper is used any time you need to take one type of Java Bean and map it to another type of Java Bean.
        Most field mapping can be done automatically by Dozer using reflection, but any custom mapping can be
        predescribed in XML format. Mapping is bi-directional so only one relationship between classes needs
        defining. If any property names on both objects are the same you do not even need to do any explicit
        property mapping for these fields.
      </p>
      <p>
        The picture below depicts some of the common areas for Dozer to be inserted into an architecture. Notice
        that it typically is utilized at the boundaries (entry/exit). Dozer will make sure that your internal
        domain objects from the database do not bleed into the presentation layer or to external consumers. It can
        also help map your domain objects to external APIs calls and vice-versa.

        The bean mapper is written in Java and relies heavily on the Jakarta Commons Bean Utils package for Java
        Bean utility methods.
