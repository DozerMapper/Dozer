      <p>Dozer is a powerful, yet simple Java Bean to Java Bean mapper that recursively copies data from one object to another.  Typically, these Java Beans will be of different complex types.  </p>
      <p>Dozer supports simple property mapping, complex type mapping, bi-directional mapping, implicit-explicit mapping, as well as recursive mapping. This includes mapping collection attributes that also need mapping at the element level.</p>
