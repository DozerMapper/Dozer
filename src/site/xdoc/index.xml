      <p>
        Dozer is a Java Bean to Java Bean mapper that recursively copies data from one object to another.
        Typically, these Java Beans will be of different complex types.
      </p>
      <p>
        Dozer supports simple property mapping, complex type mapping, bi-directional mapping, implicit-explicit
        mapping, as well as recursive mapping. This includes mapping collection attributes that also need mapping
        at the element level.
      </p>
      <p>
        Please read the
        <a href="documentation/about.html">about</a>
        page for detailed information on Dozer.

      <p>
        This release contains bug fixes and feature requests, along with internal refactoring. Some new features
        include indexed mapping within deep mapping, improved support of Map backed properties, and configuration
        of auto string trimming.
      </p>
      <p>
        The most significant refactoring was around Map backed properties. The refactoring did not change the
        public Dozer API or the xml dtd, but if you are currently using the Map backed property features of Dozer
        please thoroughly regression test your system after upgrading to 4.0 to verify that any expected behavior
        remains unchanged for your specific use cases. We do have a good amount of unit tests around the Map backed
        property feature, but please let us know if you experience any issues after upgrading and we will do
        everything we can to resolve it soon as possible.
      </p>

        Thanks again to everyone that submitted bug and feature requests, along with everyone that contributed to
